# The_Game_Of_Trusters

This is a role-playing game system that is based on relationships, trust, and fusions, the likes seen in comic books/manga and fantasy TV shows, those are the main inspirations for this system.

A Video Game adaptation is in this repository and it is mostly written in C with a bit of C++ and it is a text-based game.

The enemy artwork bodies are meant to be colorized.

You only need to compile the C++/.cpp file for the video game adaptation.
